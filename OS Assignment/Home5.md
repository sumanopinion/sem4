---

_1) shell script to find the factorial value of any integer entered through the keyboard._

```bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number:"

read num

fact=1

for (( i=1; i<=num; i++ ))

do

  fact=$((fact * i))

done

echo "The factorial of $num is: $fact"

```

---

_2) to generate all combinations of 1, 2 and 3._

```bash

#!/bin/bash

for i in 1 2 3

do

  for j in 1 2 3

  do

    for k in 1 2 3

    do

      echo "$i$j$k"

    done

  done

done

```

---

_3) print all prime numbers in a given range._

```bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter the range:"

read start end

for (( i=start; i<=end; i++ ))

do

  is_prime=true

  if [ $i -lt 2 ]; then

    is_prime=false

  fi

  for (( j=2; j<=i/2; j++ ))

  do

    if [ $((i%j)) -eq 0 ]; then

      is_prime=false

      break

    fi

  done

  if [ "$is_prime" = true ]; then

    echo $i

  fi

done

```

---

_4) to calculate the sum of digits of any number entered through keyboard._

```bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number:"

read num

sum=0

while [ $num -gt 0 ]

do

  digit=$((num%10))

  sum=$((sum + digit))

  num=$((num/10))

done

echo "The sum of digits is: $sum"

```

_5) Rajesh's basic salary (BASIC) is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance (DA) is 52% of BASIC. House rent allowance (HRA) is 15% of BASIC. Contributory provident fund is 12% of (BASIC + DA). Write a shell script to calculate his gross salary and take home salary using the following formula:_

_Gross salary = BASIC + DA + HRA._

```bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter Rajesh's basic salary:"

read BASIC

DA=$((52 * BASIC / 100))

HRA=$((15 * BASIC / 100))

CPF=$((12 * (BASIC + DA) / 100))

GROSS=$((BASIC + DA + HRA))

TAKE_HOME=$((GROSS - CPF))

echo "Rajesh's gross salary is: $GROSS"

echo "Rajesh's take home salary is: $TAKE_HOME"

```
