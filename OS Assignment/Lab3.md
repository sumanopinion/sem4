---

_e) Find the user name and group id from the file/etc/passwd using the cut command._<br>

```

---

_f) Extract the names of the users from /etc/passwd after ignoring the first 10 entries._<br>

```bash

$ tail -n +11 /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1

```

---

_g) Sort the file /etc/passwd on GUID (primary) and UID (secondary) so that the users with the same GUID are placed together. User with a lower UID should be placed higher in the list._<br>

```bash

$ sort -t: -k4,4 -k3,3n /etc/passwd

```

---

_h) List from etc/passwd the UID and the user having the highest UID._<br>

```bash

$ awk -F: '{print 3, 1}' /etc/passwd | sort -n -r | head -1

```

---

_i) Device a sequence which lists the 5 largest files in the current directory._<br>

```bash

$ ls -lS | head -5

```

---

_j) Remove duplicate lines from a file._<br>

```

---

_k) Count the frequency of occurences of words in a file._<br>

```

---

_l) Find "long" listing of the smallest 5 files in the /etc directory whose name contains the string ".conf", sorted by increasing file size._ <br>

```bash

$ find /etc -type f -name "\*.conf" -ls | sort -k7 | head -n 5

```

---

_m) Get a sorted list, with no duplicates, of all the users logged into the logged network._<br>

```bash

$ who | cut -d' ' -f1 | sort | uniq

```

---

_n) Find all files in your home directory that are more than a week old and end with .bak._ <br>

```

---

_o) How many total lines are contained in all the files ending in .c in the current directory, printing only the total number of lines._<br>

```bash

$ find . -name "\*.c" -exec wc -l {} + | tail -n1 | awk '{print 1}'

```
